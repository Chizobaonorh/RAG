# ðŸ“š Vectorized PDF Database

This project demonstrates how to convert PDF documents into a vector database for fast and accurate information retrieval. By embedding text into vector representations, the system allows you to:

âœ… Upload and process PDF files

âœ… Store their contents in a vector database

âœ… Query the database in natural language

âœ… Receive quick, context-aware, and accurate responses

This approach is especially useful for building searchable knowledge bases, chatbots, or AI assistants that can answer questions directly from your documents.
